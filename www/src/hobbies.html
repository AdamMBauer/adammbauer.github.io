		<p class="largetext">Welcome to my Hobbies Page</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		I enjoy playing video games of most genres from
		tactical resoucre management games to RPGs to more story
		focused games. I find this both fun as well as a great
		inspiration for my own ideas on how to do things better.
		I also like to spend my time reading books.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		This includes novels such as "Harry Potter", "The Power of
		Five" or the "Left hand of God" or something like The
		"Interpretation of Financial Statements" by Benjamin Graham.
		I also find	games and books from different cultures such 
		as the chinese	novel "I Shall Seal the Heavens" and 
		"Amazing cultivation simulator".
