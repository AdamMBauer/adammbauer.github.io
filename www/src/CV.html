		<p class="largetext">Welcome to my CV Page</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		Summary
		Born in Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, I moved with
		my parents from Austria to Chicago (USA) at the
		beginning of 2000 and went to kindergarten there
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		My father has a strong international orientation
		and worked for an American company until 2006. Due
		to his professional requirements, we moved back
		to Hamburg (Germany) in September 2001, where I
		also attended kindergarten and preschool until 2003.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		In 2003 we moved to Great Britain, where I spent
		all of my school years and stayed until I moved to
		Austria after completing my apprenticeship. After
		finishing compulsory school, I studied sports science
		at college and graduated successfully in 2015
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		Due to the limited career opportunities in the sports
		sector, I started an apprenticeship as a printing
		technician at Nutshell Packeting in autumn 2015,
		which I successfully completed at the end of 2017/Jan.
		2018.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		Originally, I had applied to this company as an
		apprentice in the commercial sector and alternatively
		in the logistics sector.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		However, as there was only
		one apprenticeship available in the printing sector,
		I decided, on the advice of my mother, to first do the
		apprenticeship in the printing sector, with the aim of
		being able to switch to other areas later in the
		company.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
		During 2015, when I was looking for
		apprenticeships and job offeres, the supply was fairly
		limmited in the area I was living in.
