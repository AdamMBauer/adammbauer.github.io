	hobbiesI enjoy playing video games of most genres from
	tactical resoucre management games to RPGs to more story
	focused games. I find this both fun as well as a great
	inspiration for my own ideas on how to do things better.
	I also like to spend my time reading books. This includes
	novels such as Harry Potter, the Power of Five or the left
	hand of God or something like The Interpretation of
	Financial Statements by Benjamin Graham. Another hobby of
	mine includes going to the gym where I work as a Leisure
	Assistant and working out.
