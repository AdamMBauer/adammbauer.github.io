	Summary
	Born in Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, I moved with
	my parents from Austria to Chicago (USA) at the
	beginning of 2000 and went to kindergarten there
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	My father has a strong international orientation
	and worked for an American company until 2006. Due
	to his professional requirements, we moved back
	to Hamburg (Germany) in September 2001, where I
	also attended kindergarten and preschool until 2003.
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	In 2003 we moved to Great Britain, where I spent
	all of my school years and stayed until I moved to
	Austria after completing my apprenticeship. After
	finishing compulsory school, I studied sports science
	at college and graduated successfully in 2015
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	Due to the limited career opportunities in the sports
	sector, I started an apprenticeship as a printing
	technician at Nutshell Packeting in autumn 2015,
	which I successfully completed at the end of 2017/Jan.
	2018.
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	Originally, I had applied to this company as an
	apprentice in the commercial sector and alternatively
	in the logistics sector.
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	However, as there was only
	one apprenticeship available in the printing sector,
	I decided, on the advice of my mother, to first do the
	apprenticeship in the printing sector, with the aim of
	being able to switch to other areas later in the
	company.
	</p>
	<p class="normaltext">
	During 2015, when I was looking for
	apprenticeships and job offeres, the supply was fairly
	limmited in the area I was living in.
