	Summary
	Born in Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, I moved with
	my parents from Austria to Chicago (USA) at the
	beginning of 2000 and went to kindergarten there.
	My father has a strong international orientation
	and worked for an American company until 2006. Due
	to his professional requirements, we moved back
	to Hamburg (Germany) in September 2001, where I
	also attended kindergarten and preschool until 2003.
	In 2003 we moved to Great Britain, where I spent
	all of my school years and stayed until I moved to
	Austria after completing my apprenticeship. After
	finishing compulsory school, I studied sports science
	at college and graduated successfully in 2015.
	Due to the limited career opportunities in the sports
	sector, I started an apprenticeship as a printing
	technician at Nutshell Packeting in autumn 2015,
	which I successfully completed at the end of 2017/Jan.
	2018. Originally, I had applied to this company as an
	apprentice in the commercial sector and alternatively
	in the logistics sector. However, as there was only
	one apprenticeship available in the printing sector,
	I decided, on the advice of my mother, to first do the
	apprenticeship in the printing sector, with the aim of
	being able to switch to other areas later in the
	company. During 2015, when I was looking for
	apprenticeships and job offeres, the supply was fairly
	limmited in the area I was living in.
